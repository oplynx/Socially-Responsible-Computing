# Socially-Responsible-Computing
CS 216 Project

This project is a simple student roster management system built in C++. It demonstrates the core principles of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, modularity, and reusability. The system stores and manages student data such as IDs, names, emails, ages, days in course, and degree programs. It also performs essential tasks like validating email formats, calculating average days spent in courses, and managing student data.

**Instructions to Run**

On your console run this:
`g++ main.cpp student.cpp roster.cpp -o run`
Then type this:
`./run` or `run.exe` on Windows
Make sure you're in the same directory as the files are in to run it properly.
